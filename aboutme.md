title: About me
---

I have been an Amiga user for ten years, from a stock A500 in 1991 to a towered A1200 + [BlizzardPPC](http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/blizzardppc) + [BVision](http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/blizzardvision) later on.

Back in March 2000 I had the first contacts with the *nix world, [NetBSD 1.4.2](http://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-1.4/NetBSD-1.4.2.html) on my 68030 A1200 first, then LinuxPPC 2000 shortly after.

I discovered [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) in February 2005 and I use it daily since then.

I love the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), [chiptunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune), old school sinus scroller and roto-zoomer, but I am also a big fan of recent achievements in real-time computer graphics.

All the opinions expressed here are only my own.
