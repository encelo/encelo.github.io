I started my journey in computing on the **Amiga**, first with a stock A500 in 1991, and later with a towered A1200 upgraded with a [BlizzardPPC](http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/blizzardppc) and [BVision](http://amiga.resource.cx/exp/blizzardvision).
Those years shaped my fascination with graphics, games, programming, and the culture around making machines do more than anyone thought possible.

In [March 2000](https://twitter.com/encelo/status/1241380961079693315) I had my first real contact with the *nix world, running [NetBSD 1.4.2](http://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-1.4/NetBSD-1.4.2.html) on my 68030 A1200, followed soon after by LinuxPPC 2000.
That opened the door to free software and the joy (and pain) of tinkering with low-level systems.

Since [February 2005](https://twitter.com/encelo/status/1235202504826277895) I've been a daily **Arch Linux** user. It fits the way I like to work: simple, transparent, and close to the metal.

I've always loved the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), [chiptunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune), sinus scrollers, and roto-zoomers: the playful side of pushing hardware limits. At the same time, I follow modern breakthroughs in real-time graphics with the same excitement.
