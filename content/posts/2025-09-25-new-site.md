title: A New Site
description: From Jekyll to Hugo
---

After eight years of serving me well, I decided to retire my old [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based site, which used the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme, a popular Jekyll template created by [Dean Attali](https://attalitech.com/). All content has now been migrated to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), powered by the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme by [Nuno CoraÃ§Ã£o](https://n9o.xyz/).

I needed more flexibility and more speed. Hugo feels like the perfect choice to handle my site for at least the next eight years! ðŸ’ª

I'm also looking forward to experimenting with what Hugo and Blowfish make possible, so expect more improvements and updates over time.
