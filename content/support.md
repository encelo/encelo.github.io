My work on **open source projects** like nCine and SpookyGhost has always been a labor of love.
I build and maintain these tools in my free time, and I share them so anyone can learn, create, or just enjoy tinkering with code and graphics.

If you've found value in my work, or simply want to help me keep developing and documenting these projects, you can support me through one of the platforms below.
Every contribution, big or small, makes a real difference and helps me dedicate more time to open source.
